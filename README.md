I included a premade VS 2022 project to keep things simple, it was created with premake5 using the included script

./assets -> The built fmod bank files and the audio file\
./build -> VS 2022 project\
./bin -> DLLs and where the exe is built\
./Example -> The FMOD Studio project\
./vendor -> Include / lib files for fmod and phonon\

I followed the guide for the c api, and spliced it with the guide for the fmod plugin
